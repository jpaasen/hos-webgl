* **m** Switch from linear array mode to free-hand-dawing mode
* **p** Pause/Play
* **c** Clear all sources
* **t/T** decrease/increase time step
* **f/F** decrease/increase frequency with 100 KHz
* **d/D** decrease/increase display dynamic range
* **l/L** decrease/increase array pitch with 0.1 lambda.
